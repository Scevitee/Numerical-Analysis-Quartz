title: Welcome!

Hello! This is a little project I'm starting for this class since we are moving to a flip-class style. If enough people are interested in it I'll continue adding in content for the rest of the chapter / class. I hope you get some good information from this. 

On this site I will provide:
- All definitions and theorems in the textbook
- Reiteration / explanation of code found in the textbook that I found confusing
- Reactive examples (using sliders, radio buttons, etc) 
- Modified version of at least one example per section

The tool I'm using for this has some convenience features in place:
- Full text search
- Wikilinks
- Graph view
- Markdown text editing

To get started, following this wikilink to the [[Table of Contents]]

I'm hosting this on GitHub [here](https://github.com/Scevitee/Numerical-Analysis-Quartz). If by some odd chance you want to contribute, you're more than welcome to! 

Please enjoy this stipple I made of myself using a scatter chart in Julia!
